        <p>Q: I am using GloDET site for the first time and I do not see any data in the Data Explorer. Why is that?</p>
        <p>A: In order to view high-resolution data images and download GloDET datasets, you must sign-up for a user account. Click the login button in the top right corner to start exploring.</p>
        <p>Q: I registered for a user account, but when I tried to log in I received the message “Failed to authorize user!” Why is my user account not working?</p>
        <p>A: Entering your registration information and clicking “Submit” does not immediately grant you access to the GloDET database. The Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute will review your registration information and respond to your request within 24 hours. Once your registration is approved, an email will be sent to email address you used to register that includes a link to verify your email address and sign in.
