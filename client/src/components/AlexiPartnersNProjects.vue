        <p>Select projects from GloDET’s many contributing partners are presented below to provide a better understanding of how the daily ET data may be applied.</p>
        <p>The Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute (DWFI) collaborates with partners around the globe, including government agencies, funding agencies and academic institutions, to obtain the resources needed to activate grids in the Data Explorer for which the ALEXI model is not currently computing results. If you are interested in partnering with DWFI to generate daily ET products for your region or country, please contact Director of Research Christopher Neale, at <a href="mailto:cneale@nebraska.edu">cneale@nebraska.edu</a> for more information.</p>

                <p>This project will combine the expertise of the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA), the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) and CALMIT at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Daugherty Water for Food Institute (DWFI) at the University of Nebraska and international and regional partner organizations to deliver new insights, management plans and drought resilience strategies at the national and local levels that will reduce drought impacts on the food supply and on the quantity and safety of the water supply in vulnerable communities.</p>
                <p>The Regional Drought Management System (RDMS) for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA RDMS) will focus on drought risk management through the development of monitoring and early warning systems, and preparedness and mitigation measures. It will serve the region by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Establishing a regional drought monitoring and early warning system and associated information delivery systems</li>
                  <li>Providing assessment of drought vulnerabilities and impacts</li>
                  <li>Developing actions and measures to mitigate and respond to drought impacts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The RDMS will monitor regional drought conditions, assist with drought planning and coordination activities, and assist officials who are charged with relief efforts by providing “value-added” information during drought events. A critical part of its mission is to provide training and capacity building throughout the region in the operation of monitoring and early warning systems, developing communications and delivery technology, and conducting stakeholder engagement activities.</p>
                <p>This project will partner with and build on previous and on-going efforts in the region, including USAID’s many programs and international efforts in drought management by FAO, WMO, UN-Water and others.</p>
                <p>The outcome will be a unique capability for regional drought management, providing effective, collaborative, science- and society-based programs for developing a unified regional platform for drought monitoring, policy and preparedness. It will serve as a model for other regions in preparing for drought and managing its impacts.</p>
                <p>The overall objective of this project is to empower decision-makers to plan for and manage the impacts of droughts on food and water security under current and future climate conditions.</p>
